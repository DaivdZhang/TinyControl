# How to contribute to TinyControl
First of all, thank you for taking your time to work
on this project.:smile:


## Before you contribute

### Issue Template
__There is no specific template for the new issue right now.__

But it is recommended to give
+ a simple and clear issue title
+ descriptions about the problem and the solution.
    + the runtime environment
    + error messages
    + the code to reproduce the bug
    + ...

### Pull Request
+ A pull request should have clear descriptions.
+ Include the related issue number if available.

### Code Style
The TinyControl follows the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style.
But there exist some __exceptions__.
+ Since the control theory often plays with matrices, use single uppercase characters(A, B, C, ...)
to name a matrix variable is acceptable.
+ Naming identity matrix as __I__ is ok as long as it doesn't cause misunderstanding.
+ The maximum line length could exceed 79 characters a bit more(maybe less than 100 characters).
Anyway don't squash a bunch of codes into a single line.


## If you find a bug
+ You could search the Github issue page then check whether the bug has
been already reported.
+ If you are unable to find a relevant issue, open up a new one.

## If you fixed a bug
+ You could open a new pull request.


## If you come up with a new idea
+ Open a new issue then discuss with other people.
+ Open a pull request related to the issue if you get positive feedback.
